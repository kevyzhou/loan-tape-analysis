Cleaning and analyzing a sample loan tape


Prompt: A potential debt investor is interested in purchasing notes backed by this loan portfolio. The original $10,755,386 was financed by $8,000,000 of a senior note and $2,755,386 of a equity note. The current principal balance of the senior note is $5,480,930 and has an interset rate of 7.0%.  All student payments received go to paying interest and principal on the senior note until the senior note is fully paid off and then all payments go to the owners of the subordinate note. Accompanying this case study is an Excel file that contains the basic information on loans originated (Loan_Tape.xlsx). How would you analyze and present the data contained in the Excel file and value the senior note and equity to a potential investor?
